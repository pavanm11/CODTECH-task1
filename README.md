Overview of the Project
Project:Linear Regression on Housing Prices
OBJECTIVE:
This project involves building a linear regression model to predict housing prices in Boston based on various features. Linear regression is a statistical method used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. In this case, the dependent variable is the median value of owner-occupied homes (medv), and the independent variables are various factors that could influence house prices.
Project Steps:
1.Import Libraries
2.Load the Dataset
3.Data Exploration and Visualization
4.Preprocessing the Data
5.Train a Linear Regression Model
6.Evaluate the Model
7.Visualize the Results
